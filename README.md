PLEASE, I DO THE CODING AND DEBUGGING OF THE APP ALONE, BE AWARE THAT IT WILL TAKE ME A LONG TIME.  I WANT BUG REPORTS AND LOGS IF YOU CAN TOO. Thanks a lot!

Metatron - Advanced Multi-Platform Debugging Tool
Metatron is an advanced, AI-powered debugging tool designed to analyze and debug code across various programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, AI frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch), and blockchain (Solidity). Metatron features a beautiful, responsive user interface and supports multi-platform deployment on Windows, Linux, and the web.


+++ Features

   Multi-Language Support: Supports various programming languages and frameworks.

   AI-Powered Analysis: Utilizes advanced AI models for accurate error detection and debugging.

   Quantum Computing Support: Visualize and simulate quantum circuits, with quantum-specific error detection and debugging.

   Real-Time Collaboration: Collaborate on debugging sessions in real-time.

   Secure and Private: Robust protection against web injection, buffer overflow, and other vulnerabilities.

   Beautiful and Responsive UI: Intuitive and modern UI design.

+++ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run Metatron on your local machine.

+++ Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm
- Python 3.6 or later
- MySQL database
- Tor (for secure communication)

+++ Installation
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/metatron.git
cd metatron
2. Install dependencies
Electron and React dependencies:
npm install
Python Flask dependencies:
pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy flask_login werkzeug transformers requests[socks] flask-wtf fpdf stem openai qiskit pymysql matplotlib flask-cors
3. Configure the database
Update the database configuration in app.py:
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'mysql+pymysql://username:password@hostname/database'
4. Configure Tor
+++ Install Tor and configure it with a password:
sudo apt-get install tor
sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
+++ Add the following lines to the Tor configuration file:
ControlPort 9051
HashedControlPassword 16:YOUR_HASHED_PASSWORD
CookieAuthentication 1

+++ Restart Tor:
sudo service tor restart

+++ Running the Application
1. Start the Flask backend
python app.py
2. Start the React frontend
npm start
3. Package the Electron app (optional)
   
+++ To build the Electron app for Windows:
npm run package-win

+++ To build the Electron app for Linux:
npm run package-linux
