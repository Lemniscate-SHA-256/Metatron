🛠 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run Metatron on your local machine.

📋 Prerequisites

Node.js and npm
Python 3.6 or later
MySQL database
Tor (for secure communication)

📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/metatron.git
cd metatron

3. Install dependencies
   
Electron and React dependencies:
npm install

Python Flask dependencies:
pip install flask flask_sqlalchemy flask_login werkzeug transformers requests[socks] flask-wtf fpdf stem openai qiskit pymysql matplotlib flask-cors

5. Configure the database
Update the database configuration in app.py:
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'mysql+pymysql://username:password@hostname/database'

6. Configure Tor
Install Tor and configure it with a password:

sh
Copy code
sudo apt-get install tor
sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
Add the following lines to the Tor configuration file:

plaintext
Copy code
ControlPort 9051
HashedControlPassword 16:YOUR_HASHED_PASSWORD
CookieAuthentication 1
Restart Tor:
sudo service tor restart

▶️ Running the Application

1. Start the Flask backend
python app.py

3. Start the React frontend
npm start

5. Package the Electron app (optional)

To build the Electron app for Windows:
npm run package-win

To build the Electron app for Linux:
npm run package-linux
